Please correct the text extracted by OCR and extract the following entities and values as key-value pairs, outputting them in valid JSON format. 

IMPORTANT: Output must be valid JSON with:
- All property names enclosed in double quotes
- No trailing commas in objects or arrays
- All strings properly escaped

All fields in the output JSON are mandatory; if any key has no corresponding value, please set the value to an empty string '' to prevent any key or value from being null. If any text assumed to represent a date contains a Japanese era name, such as "令和," and is not in a four-digit year format, please convert it to the Gregorian calendar (Western calendar year). For example, "元年" should be treated as year 1, "平成1年" should start from 1989, and "令和1年" from 2019.
